# CODSOFT
I include all the necessary dependencies needed to reproduce thr project. so that the reader can install them before replicating the project.
The crucial part of any data science project is dataset which I got from the task given by the company (CODSOFT). The list of all the data sources used in all these projects, including links to the original data, descriptions an dany pre-processing steps that were taken.
# Source Data
I listed of the data that was used along with the source link and added a few lines to describe the data
# Data Preprocessing
Acquired data is not always squeaky clean, so preprocessing them are integreal part of any data analysis
# Code Structure
Here I will explain the code structure and how it is organiszed. This will help others to understand my project and find specific componenets

# Results and evaluation
I have provided an overview of the results of my project, including the relevant metrics and graphs, including a short expalnations of any evaluation methodlogies and how they were used.

# Related project and dataset
Task1.ipynb is releated with the tested.csv data where I have builded  a model that predicts whether a passanger on Titanic survived or not
Task_3.ipynb is related with the IRIS.csv dataset where I have builded a model that can learn from the measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species
Task_4.ipynb is related with the advertising.csv where I forecasted the amount of a product that customers will purchase taking various factors
